In response, India too summoned the Canadian High Commissioner in New Delhi informing him to leave the country on Tuesday.\r\n\r\n\"The concerned diplomat has been asked to leave India within the next five days,\" India\'s Ministry of External Affairs said.\r\n\r\nFO rebukes Indian allegations over IIOJK encounter\r\nAddressing Indian allegations linking Pakistan with the Anantnag encounter over in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), Baloch said that India has a â€œhabit of implicating Pakistan in anything that happens under its watch\", especially in the illegally occupied territory.\r\n\r\nResponding to a question pertaining to Pakistan\'s engagement with India at levels of the foreign ministries and Director General Military Operations (DGMOs), the FO spokesperson apprised that the main channel of communication between Pakistan and India, i.e., at the level of diplomatic missions had reduced its strength to charge dâ€™affaires.\r\n\r\n\"If functional, the DGMO level also existed between the two countries,\" she added.\r\n\r\nExpressing Pakistan\'s willingness to hold talks with India, the spokesperson said that Pakistan is ready to hold talks with India on all disputes, especially the core disputed Himalayan territory.\r\n\r\nâ€œWith regard to third-party mediation, Pakistan has always said that we would welcome it on the IIOJK issue on the basis of the UN Security Council resolutions and in accordance with the principles of international law,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, commenting on India\'s state-sponsored human rights violation in the occupied valley, Baloch highlighted that the Indian occupation forces in IIOJK have killed 68 Kashmiris, including women and children with 13 custodial killings in the first eight months of 2023 alone.\r\n\r\nWhereas 2,900 persons including political activists, businesspeople, women, and youth were arbitrarily arrested, she added.', '62', '20 Sep, 2023', 39, '1695232185-p4.jpg', 1),

This historic move has received support from all opposition parties, who argue that delaying its implementation until 2029, after the next national elections, is unjust to women.\r\n\r\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman explained during a parliamentary debate that the law will be enacted in the 2029 national elections, allowing time for a new census and the adjustment of voting districts after next year\'s polls.\r\n\r\nUnder this legislation, women will exclusively contest 33% of the seats in the elected lower house of parliament and state legislatures. The reservation of seats for women will initially continue for 15 years and may be extended by parliament.\r\n\r\nIndia\'s once-in-a-decade census, initially scheduled for 2021, was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a delay in the implementation of this law.\r\n\r\nDespite women constituting over 48% of India\'s population of more than 1.4 billion, their representation in parliament stands at a mere 15.1%, far below the international average of 24%, as stated by Law and Justice Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal. In state legislatures, women occupy only about 10% of the seats.\r\n\r\nAttempts to enact such legislation date back to 1996, with successive governments making four unsuccessful efforts to pass it. Regional parties had initially opposed the bill, fearing that seats reserved for women would be dominated by the educated urban elite, leaving marginalised and less-educated women unrepresented.\r\n\r\nOver the years, however, opposition to the bill has waned, and it has gained broader support as politicians recognise the need to be responsive to emerging constituencies, particularly women. \r\n\r\nIndia\'s patriarchal society has often marginalised women, and this legislation is a significant step towards gender parity and more inclusive governance.\r\n\r\nThis historic decision reflects India\'s commitment to addressing gender disparities and promoting equal political participation for women in the country.
